# Logboss

Logboss is a WIP project intended to be a log reading and parsing tool for custom logs generated by our distributed data system

## Setup

Logboss expects a .env file that will set at least the basic environment variables of
````
HOST=x.x.x.x
PORT=xxxx
````

These will be specific to your production / test environment. The .env is also a good place to keep any secrets or keys that the software might need, *just make sure not to commit a .env with secrets in it!*
